# A Brief Timeline of Pieter Levels' Flight Simulator (or the Ten Thousand One-Shots Rule)

If you‚Äôre on X at all, you‚Äôve likely seen Pieter Levels‚Äô new flight simulator at <a href="https://fly.pieter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly.pieter.com</a> He started it about 10 days ago. Since then, he has posted almost 100 times about the project on his timeline, and likely much more in the comments. According to his bio on X, he‚Äôs already made $38,000 selling in-game ads and fighter jets. 

I got inspired by this and decided to comb through Pieter‚Äôs timeline to map out the trajectory of the project. In this article I will go through a brief timeline of the game‚Äôs development and then discuss AI-driven game development in general.

## The Beginnings of a Flight Sim

On **February 22nd** he started building his flight simulator and made his first post about it.

He had never used Three.js before. He made it live to play the same day.

On **February 24**, Anthropic added the ability to create missiles because of Levels saying that Claude was giving him problems creating missiles due to AI safety measures.

By **February 25th** he had 200 players online

Then 500 players.

On **February 26** Elon Musk quoted it in a post.

To which Levels responded by adding Mars to the game.

On the same day, he made it possible to buy an F-16 for $29.99

Next, he gets the brilliant idea to sell ads on blimps from an X user @thekitze.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if we sell blimps, what price should we charge though? <a href="https://t.co/WavO7DP23e">https://t.co/WavO7DP23e</a> <a href="https://t.co/8G7jtmAvSF">pic.twitter.com/8G7jtmAvSF</a></p>&mdash; @levelsio (@levelsio) <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1894809933448700404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

By **February 27th** he had already earned $1270 with the game and 89,000 people had tried it.

He added dogfighting so you can shoot planes down.

On **March 1** he added joystick / gamepad support.

https://x.com/levelsio/status/1895892285575086376

By **March 2** he had made $17000 with ads and $360 by selling planes and someone bought the Moon and Mars for $5000.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone just bought the moon/mars ü§Ø<br><br>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisbuildsai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lewisbuildsai</a> <a href="https://t.co/46XpT7WRsl">https://t.co/46XpT7WRsl</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCaShRix0H">pic.twitter.com/cCaShRix0H</a></p>&mdash; @levelsio (@levelsio) <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1896287574039384233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On the same day someone also bought Jupiter for $5000. 

https://x.com/levelsio/status/1896351936179556860

As of **March 3**, as many as 16,000 people in one day have flown in the game and he has raised in-game ads to $5,000 per month. 

The mechanics are simple and need refinement, but the seeds of a game are all there. Right now, you can fly up to Mars and Jupiter. Personally, I think it would be a cool feature if you could enter the different planets‚Äô atmosphere and then it brings you to a new level with different terrain.

## A bright future for AI games, or the Ten Thousand One-Shots rule.

One-shotting trivial games with bouncing balls, such as Pong clones, has become a common metric for evaluating state of the art LLMs. These examples are good beginnings, but the true differentiation emerges when you combine ten thousand one-shots together. In honor of the Ten Thousand Hour Rule by Malcolm Gladwell, let‚Äôs dub it *The Ten Thousand One-Shots Rule*. 

First, you need to ensure the game is playable by developing basic mechanics and simple models. Once the fundamental idea is working, then you start fine-tuning everything and getting user feedback. Make it fun and interactive. Refine the models. Then start going into detail on the things that work.

It‚Äôs inspiring that Levels immediately started getting results with modern LLMs, despite never having used Three.js before. This example shows that one person can leverage AI to create things for users while learning in the process. 

Perhaps a new age of venture funding is upon us. A future in which you can build things, get users, and learn, all at lightning speed. If you broadcast your work on social media, many people are happy to help fund development by pitching in. Of course, having hundreds of thousands of followers doesn‚Äôt hurt!

He has his detractors no doubt. But results are results. And honestly, with a name like ‚ÄúLevels,‚Äù it makes sense that his destiny might be to create video games. But the most inspiring part is that anyone can do this. The only limiting factor is imagination.

This may be the opening salvo in the race of AI-driven game development, demonstrating how small and agile teams can get a large advantage over more established but slower-moving game development companies. While anyone can use these tools to generate code, breakthroughs demand relentless effort over a sustained period of time.
